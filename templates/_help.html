            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>The StoryMapJS editor uses your Google account to make sure that only you can edit your storymaps. This saves you from needing to remember another password, and saves us from having to help you if you forget it. We only ask for your "profile," which gives us a unique identifier which we can use to connect you to your projects. We don't have your name or G-mail address.</p>
            <p>Originally, the StoryMapJS editor stored your projects on your Google Drive, but that is no longer the case. We used to ask for access to your Google Drive. If you made storymaps a very long time ago and have not used the tool since, we may need to ask you to give us permission to read from your Google Drive to "migrate" your old projects.</p>
            <p>Please note that it is possible to use StoryMapJS without a Google account; however, it is not possible to use our editor tool. If you prefer not to use a Google account, you will need to manually edit a configuration file and you will need to serve your configuration file and any related media assets from your own server. Some more information about this can be found on our <a href="/advanced/">StoryMap for Technical Users</a> page.</p>
